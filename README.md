# great-barrier-reef-visualization

The project is about coral bleaching data for 8 sites in the Great Barrier Reef(Australia). It gives the % of bleaching for different kinds of coral: hard corals, sea pens, blue corals, soft corals and sea fans over the last 8 years.

* Alternatively, the app is published and can be accessed in below URL:

    * The working directory needs to have the following files :
